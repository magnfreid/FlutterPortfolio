Hello, my name is Magnus Freidenfelt. I’m 38 years old and currently studying mobile app development at Folkuniversitetet in Gothenburg (in my second and final year). I reside near Uppsala with my partner and our 12-year-old son.

I’ve always been fascinated by how things work and have made a habit of trying to understand the inner workings of any kind of technology like electronics, wiring, software, and repairing and renovating household items. Professionally, I spent several years as a technician repairing appliances and machinery, primarily for Electrolux.

Approximately five years ago, during the COVID lockdown, I began writing my first lines of Python. Since then, I’ve explored various programming languages and frameworks. A couple of years ago, my interest in development intensified to the point where I decided to quit my job to pursue a degree in app development.

When building apps, I prioritize clear architecture, modular design, and efficient data flow - usually via established patterns, if they fit the project. In group school projects, I’ve often been responsible for tracking data flow and repositories, identifying redundant backend calls, and refactoring ”spaghetti” code to maintain an MVVM pattern, for example.

While visual design isn’t my primary focus, I strive to create simple, efficient, and user-friendly designs rather than overly complex and fancy ones. I personally like apps where the most used and most important features are within arm’s reach, and less used features are tucked away in the background to not clutter the interface.
