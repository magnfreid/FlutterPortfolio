Hello, my name is Magnus Freidenfelt. I'm a 38-year-old aspiring mobile app developer currently studying at Folkuniversitetet in Gothenburg and living close to Uppsala with my partner and son.

I have a deep-seated curiosity for technology, driven by a desire to understand how things work at a fundamental level. This extends to hands-on activities like repairing electronics, electrical wiring, repairing all kinds of stuff at my home and more.
Professionally, I spent several years as a technician, repairing appliances and machinery, mainly for Electrolux.

About five years ago, I wrote my first few lines of Python. Since then, I've explored various languages, frameworks, and technologies.
My passion for development grew to the point where I decided to make a career change, leading me to my current studies.

In app development, I'm particularly drawn to robust app architecture, ensuring scalability and modularity, and optimizing data flow for efficient and high-performing applications.
